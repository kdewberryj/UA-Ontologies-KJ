# UAOntologyStack
Collection of OML ontologies developed by the University of Arizona to support Digital Engineering

### UA Foundation Ontology

The UA Foundation Ontology is based on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)

### UA Core Ontologies

The UA Ontology Stack makes use of five Core ontologies:

* Information
* Agent
* Event
* Measurement
* Provenance

### UA Domain Ontologies

The UA Ontology Stack makes use of ten Domain ontologies:

* Acquisition
* Data Management
* Materials
* Mission
* Modeling and Simulation
* Project Management
* Requriements

* System Architecture
* Test

### Application Frameworks

Application frameworks can be built on top of the UA Ontology Stack.
The following application frameworks are included in this repo:

* DoD TEMP Framework

The DoD TEMP Framework is an OML-based representation of the Test and Evaluation Master Plan presented by the DoD in the document DoDI 5000.89.

It has been applied to two example projects:

* DoD Example (an anonymized test program)
* DoD Example Rover (applied to a notional Rover test program)
